Notes on results from java document Problem3

Cubic run times: as n increases, the amount of time similarly increases,
getting much larger each time


Exponential run times: as n increases, the time gets a lot larger each
time... except with test 2, I'm not sure why it goes down on test 2...
I also tried it with slightly larger numbers but it was taking too long 
to finish, which I take as a good sign


Constant run times: all of the run times are on a similar order of magnitude,
around 27000 nano seconds, any discrepancies have to do with accessing memory 
because no matter what the n is, it is doing the exact same amount of work.
